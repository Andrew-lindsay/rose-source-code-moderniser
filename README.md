# Source code modernisations tools
Masters of informatics project utilising the ["Rose"](http://rosecompiler.org/) source to source compiler framework.

## Requirements to compile Tools
An installed version of rose (0.9.10.64 was used during development), as the tools are compiled to dynamically link the rose libraries.

To compile rose from source follow the instruction on the [http://rosecompiler.org/ROSE_HTML_Reference/group__installation.html](rose homepage) or use this more direct [https://github.com/rose-compiler/rose-develop/blob/master/scripts/2017-03-ROSE-Unbuntu-16.04-VM-setup.sh](guide) which is used to install rose onto a clean Ubuntu VM.

Alternatively you can download the precompiled ROSE binary.

IN ALL CASES REMEMBER TO ADD THE ROSE LIBRARIES TO YOUR PATH SO IT IS VISABLE.
